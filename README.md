# DA2-Project
In order to run the code you need:
- The Project.ipynb file in main
- The csv file containing the dataset <br>
This can be done by cloning the repo to your local computer, opening the repo in codespaces, or by downloading the individual files and storing them in the same directory. 

The final code block in the notebook contains the program, everything before it is how we tested some of the features and early runs of our code. This section of code starts at the header labeled "Final version of code". Some of the code before this section contains early versions of data analysis (more of which can be found on other branches), manipulations of the data and other experimental blocks to get familiar with the cosine similarity scores function provided in the scikit-learn library. These early code sections can be safely ignored for the purpose of running the program.
